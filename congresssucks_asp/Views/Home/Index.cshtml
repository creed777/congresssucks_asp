            <h2>Why <i>Congress Sucks!?</i></h2>
            <p>
                The title of this site is inteded to be tongue-in-cheek.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't think it's funny, you should  probably leave now!&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Congress Sucks! because they have abandonded thier sworn duty.&nbsp;&nbsp;The oath of office for members of Congress begins:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    "I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same..."
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                I believe the majority of actions taken by any given Congress are not constitutional and thus violate thier oath to "bear true faith and allegiance". &nbsp;&nbsp;
                I am not a lawyer, I am not a politician and I don't consider myself a constitutional expert.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just an ordinary citizen who reads the Constitution and doesn't understand how it could be difficult to interpret.&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this site is to offer an ordinary citizen's perspective on recent events and questions in light of a plain reading of the Constitution of the United States.
